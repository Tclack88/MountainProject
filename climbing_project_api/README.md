Tracking your "climbing pyramid" is an easy way to determine if you have a strong foundation in the grades you climb and are ready to try the next grade. The problem with pyramids in general is that it can be very area dependent -- for example a 5.11a is likely much more difficult in Yosemite, CA than in Indian Creek, UT. This provides the opportunity to dynamically track your progress and set goals.
